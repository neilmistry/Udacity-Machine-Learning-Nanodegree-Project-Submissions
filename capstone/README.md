# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project
## Submission by Neil Mistry

Requirements:  Python 2.7, scikit-learn 0.18.1, ipython (jupyter notebooks), keras 2.0.2 , tensorflow 1.0.1

Recommendations:  Keras with tensorflow-gpu backend enabled, use gpu for keras.  Model will be slow to compute using cpu.

Code for Naive Bayes model in naivebayes.ipynb, code for CNN model in cnn.ipynb
test predictions in naive_bayes.csv and cnn.csv (used for submssion into kaggle)
